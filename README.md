# personal-scripts-and-configs

i like to configure and tinker with gnu/linux and these are my scripts and configs

if you want to use these scripts you will likely need to configure them to work with your own system

a lot of scripts depend on dmenu

there is weird software like dmenu and dwm included, where the source code itself must be edited and recompiled to configure them
